### **Overview**
In this repository, a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** language model inspired by the *Bengio et al. (2003)* research paper has been implemented for **character-level predictions**, following Andrej Karpathy's approach in the **Makemore - Part 2** video.

The implementation demonstrates building and training the MLP model for sequence prediction while further enhancing the understanding of neural network architectures for language modeling.
